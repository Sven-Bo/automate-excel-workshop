Thereâ€™s a lot of pain points in Excel that make it a tool thatâ€™s cumbersome and repetitive for data manipulation. But did you know that you can also use Python to automate repetitive tasks in Excel?

In this workshop, I will be sharing my favorite ways to automate Microsoft Excel using Python. In particular, we will be using the open-source tools: Pandas, xlwings & plotly. After this workshop, you will be able to create a custom Python script that allows you to combine excel files & create charts out of them.
